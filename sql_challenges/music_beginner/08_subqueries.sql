-- Subqueries can be used to compare values to a derived value
-- 1. Find the songs with a longer duration than average
SELECT 
    song_name, duration
FROM
    songs
WHERE
    duration > (SELECT AVG(duration) FROM songs);

SELECT AVG(duration) FROM songs;

-- Find each song's biggest fans. List all users who have rated a song higher than the song's average.
SELECT 
    song_id, song_name, username, rating
FROM 
    songs AS s 
        JOIN 
    ratings AS r ON r.song_id = s.id
WHERE 
    rating > (  SELECT AVG(rating)
    		    FROM ratings AS rs
    		    WHERE rs.song_id = r.song_id    )
ORDER BY song_id;

SELECT 
    song_id, AVG(rating)
FROM
    ratings
GROUP BY song_id;

-- Shyma
SELECT s.song_name,r.username, r.song_id,Rat_avg,r.rating
FROM ratings r
JOIN
(SELECT song_id, AVG(rating) AS Rat_avg FROM ratings GROUP BY song_id) AS Avg_Song_Rating
ON Avg_Song_Rating.song_id = r.song_id
JOIN songs s ON s.id= r.song_id
WHERE rating > Rat_avg
ORDER BY song_id;

-- Subqueries are quite flexible, and can appear almost anywhere in a query
-- 2. Select the longest song in each genre
SELECT 
    genre, song_name, duration
FROM
    songs
JOIN
    (   SELECT genre, MAX(duration) AS longest
        FROM songs GROUP BY genre           ) AS genre_longest  -- subqueries in FROM or JOIN clauses must have an alias
	USING (genre) 
WHERE
    duration = longest;


SELECT 
    genre, MAX(duration) AS longest
FROM
    songs
GROUP BY genre;

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    songs
        JOIN
    (SELECT 
        genre, MAX(duration) AS longest
    FROM
        songs
    GROUP BY genre) AS genre_longest USING (genre);   
    
-- Sometimes, subqueries can offer performance gains over queries performed with joins. Compare the run times of these two queries.
-- 3. List the names of all songs performed by artists who debuted before 1970.            
SELECT *
FROM songs
JOIN artists ON songs.artist_id = artists.id
WHERE debut_year < 1970;

SELECT song_name, artist_id 
FROM songs 
WHERE artist_id IN (SELECT id 
                    FROM artists 
                    WHERE debut_year < 1970);

SELECT 
    id
FROM
    artists
WHERE
    debut_year < 1970;
    
    
-- Subqueries can be easier to read or write, though they may take some time to get used to. These two queries return the same results.
-- 4. Find the average rating for each song and display it alongside the song name.
SELECT 
    song_name, AVG(rating)
FROM
    songs s
        LEFT JOIN
    ratings ON s.id = ratings.song_id
GROUP BY s.id;

SELECT s.song_name, s.id, 
       (SELECT AVG(rating) 
        FROM ratings r 
        WHERE r.song_id = s.id) AS avg_rating
FROM songs AS s;
