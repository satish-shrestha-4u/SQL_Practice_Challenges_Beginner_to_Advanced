-- CASEs allow you to create new columns, with the values dependent on conditions that you set

-- When SELECTed, the CASE needs to be separated from other columns by a comma ,
-- Categorize songs by their duration (short, medium, long)
-- Short: less than 210 seconds
-- Medium: 210 - 300 seconds
-- Long: more than 300 seconds

-- but any row meeting the first condition will be labelled such

-- Rate song popularity based on number of ratings received
-- 3 or more ratings: "Popular"
-- Less than 3 ratings: "Not popular"

-- Classify songs based on their genre (Pop, Rock, Other)
